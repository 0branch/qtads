Things to do (in no particular order) as of QTads 1.8.
(The list is somewhat incomplete.  Ironic, isn't it?)

You can also search through the sources for the string "TODO:".

-  The context-menu should include an "add word/selection to command"
   entry.  This is usefull for cases where a word is too complicated to
   type by hand, especially for non-english folks (or
   non-whatever-language the game is written in).

-  Fix os_locate() (maybe don't just look-up the game's directory)

-  Implement os_sleep_ms().

-  Being able to run compressed games (zip, gzip, bzip2, etc) would be nice.
