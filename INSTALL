First of all, if you're on Gentoo Linux or some other portage-based system, then
there's no need to continue; you can find QTads ebuilds in the
"interactive-fiction" overlay; simply add it with the "layman" utility and then
emerge the "games-engines/qtads" package:

  layman -a interactive-fiction
  emerge games-engines/qtads

Otherwise, read on.

QTads uses qmake as its build system.  To build it:

  cd <directory where you unpacked the QTads sources>
  qmake
  make -j4

(Replace "-j4" with the amount of CPUs on your machine. "-j2" for a dual-core
CPU, for example.)

This will create a "qtads" binary which you can then copy and run from anywhere.
There are no files that need to be installed.

You can disable audio support when building by running qmake like this instead:

  qmake -config disable-audio

This will produce a version of QTads that does not support audio.

For it to build correctly, you will need to have the Qt5 libraries along with
their development headers/tools installed. 
  
If audio support is enabled, you'll also need:

  SDL 2
  libsndfile
  libfluidsynth
  libvorbisfile
  libmpg123

Most Linux distributions provide the development versions in packages that have
"-dev" appended to the package name.
