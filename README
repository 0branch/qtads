About Tads and QTads
====================

QTads is a so called "interpreter" for games created with the Text
Adventure Development System, or "Tads" for short, a C-like object
oriented programming language for authoring Interactive Fiction
(similar to the Infocom or Legend Entertainment games, like "Zork").
Yes, we are talking about text adventures here.

The Tads compiler creates executables for the Tads Virtual Machine (the
"Tads VM").  QTads is an implementation of this Virtual Machine; it
runs Tads VM executables.  One can also say that QTads is a Tads VM
emulator.  This is similar to Java; the Java compiler creates JavaVM
programs which must be executed with a JavaVM implementation.

Both Tads 2 as well as Tads 3 games are supported.

QTads is not written from scratch; it uses Mike Roberts' portable
reference implementations of the two Tads VMs; the T2 VM (written in C)
and T3 VM (written in C++).

On what systems does it run?
============================

Theoretically, it should run on *any* system for which a Qt-port exists
(many Unices, including Linux and Mac OSX, Windows, Haiku, even embedded
devices like cell phones and PDAs).  The systems it is known to run are
Linux, Mac OS X 10.5 and newer, MS Windows XP/Vista/7 and Haiku.


What's Interactive Fiction?
===========================

Well, this is just a poor README file and therefore not the appropriate
place for an introduction to Interactive Fiction.  For more information
about Interactive Fiction (or "IF" for short), just go to the Tads page
(see above) and follow some links.  Or search for "interactive fiction"
in Google; you'll be amazed about how many results you'll get.  And
you'll be even more amazed about how active the IF community is.

At qtads.sourceforge.net you can find further information about online
places where the community gathers and where to find games.


I don't like QTads.  It sucks.
==============================

Then help me improve it.  Send me suggestions and bug reports, or even
code if you know C++ and Qt.  Now!  Don't be afraid to do it.  Thank
you.
