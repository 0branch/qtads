Thanks to all of you!  I hope you have forgiven me the ugliness and
instability of QTads alpha 1.

Thanks fly out to:

  Alan Mead
  Beni Serfaty
  Christophe Antoine
  Curt Siffert
  Leif Huhn
  Ornithopter
  Petter Sjölund
  Samuel Verschelde
  Stefan Müller
  Tony Houlbrooke
  Xenius

for the ideas, source code and bug reports.

And of course, Mike Roberts; if there would be no Mike, there would be
no Tads!  (In case you don't already know, the very core of QTads,
namely the portable reference implementation, is written by Mike.)
