Note: The below is outdated and still refers to QTads 1.x.  Qt 4 has
dropped support for some of the below platforms and compilers and
introduced support for others.


Although QTads has only been tested on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X
(all with the GNU C++ compiler), it should build and run on many more.
This is the list of systems that are able to run the Qt library:

    (System - Compilers)

    aix        - g++, xlc
    bsdi       - g++
    dgux       - g++
    freebsd    - g++
    hpux       - acc, cc, g++, n64, o64
    hurd       - g++
    irix       - g++, cc, cc-64, cc-o32
    linux      - g++, cxx, kcc
    mac os x   - g++, project builder
    netbsd     - g++
    openbsd    - g++
    openunix   - cc, g++
    qnx        - g++
    reliant    - 64, cds
    sco        - g++
    solaris    - 64, cc, g++
    tru64      - cxx, g++
    ultrix     - g++
    unixware   - g++
    unixware 7 - g++, cc
    ms-windows - borland, msvc, msvc.net, mingw

Now don't take it for granted that QTads will run in each and every one
of these systems.  But, if you're using one of them and QTads doesn't
compile/run, there's a big chance that the modifications required are
minimal, since -- to the best of my knowledge -- the source code is
pure ANSI-C and C++, and no other third-party libraries other than Qt
are required; please report back to the maintainer (see the file
AUTHORS) if you try to build on one of the untested systems.  The rule
is: if you have the Qt library available on your system, QTads should
build and run without problems.
